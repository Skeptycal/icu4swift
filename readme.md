# ICU4Swift

For the moment, this is just me messing around and having fun. Don't expect anything even half way complete or functional. Seriously.

The theoretical end goal is a usable UText interface that directly uses Swift Strings, and regular expression syntax that builds on top of that. This could potentially be useful after Swift 2.0 is released as open source for linux, as it would give you some functionality you otherwise wouldn't have without depending on GNUStep/cocoatron/other.

Also, I'm bored.
